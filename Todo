1) Fix GC's so they are allocated and de_allocated per-window

2) Fix hello etc in the lib dir

3) piff up documentation

4) grep after XXXX for frej's comments

Do I want to open windows on different screens on the same display??

Why should I ever want to do this?

I only ever open things on the default display (as set in the DISPLAY
variable)
